## Overview of Election-Audit
A member from the Colorado Board of Elections needs an audit completed for a recent state election between three candidates.  The audit needs to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the recent election, and must include the following information:
1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of the counties where votes were cast, the total number of votes cast for each county, and the overall percentage of votes cast for each county
3. A complete list of candidates who received votes, the total number of votes cast for each candidate, and the overall percentage of votes won by each candidate
4. The winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary
After reviewing the information above, it is clear that the election winner is Diana DeGette, with a vote count of 272, 892 (73.8% overall).  In addition, the audit script that was used provides a simple, comprehensive tool that can also be useful for future election audits.  Dependent upon the election data, modifications to the script through refactoring and additional code can be used to acquire the desired audit information.  If more specific detail is needed, some of the script could be used multiple times to find the percentage and/or vote counts each candidate receives in every county, which would provide a more thorough understanding of how well each candidate performs.  Other options would include discovering which counties had the highest/lowest turnout compared to the number of registered voters in that county.  Gender, age, race, and employment information could all be added to the script to gain a detailed summary of the demographics for that area.
